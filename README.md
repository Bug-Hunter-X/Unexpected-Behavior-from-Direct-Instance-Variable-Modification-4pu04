This example demonstrates a common issue in Ruby where directly modifying instance variables using `instance_variable_set` can lead to unforeseen consequences.  While seemingly functional, it bypasses the intended access control and can make code harder to maintain and debug.  The recommended approach is to use accessor methods (getters and setters) to interact with instance variables, thus maintaining encapsulation and providing a controlled interface.
